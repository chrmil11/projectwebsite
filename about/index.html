      <h2>About IIT Rocket League</h2>
      <p>
        Created as a team under the Scarlet Computer &amp; Console Gaming club, the IIT
        Rocket League team was initialized in the Fall 2017 semester. Originally starting out
        as a trio of students looking for others that were trying to find others to play with,
        the team is slowly training to compete at a higher level.

    <h2>About the CCA</h2>
    <p>
      The College Carball Association, also known as the CCA, is a college community-driven
      organization targeting university Rocket League players to come together to represent
      their school, hang out, practice, and compete in intense, friendly intercollegiate
      competition. If you're interested, stop by their <a href="https://discord.me/CCA">Discord
      channel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/collegecarball">Twitter</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/collegecarball">Twitch</a> accounts. They're pretty cool.
